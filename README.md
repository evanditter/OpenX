# OpenX

Beginning of an app for student exchange marketplace.

Basic idea was to give college students an exchange that is specific to their college. Did background research like surveys and interviews to see if it was an interest for students. Found it was and started to design the basic layout of OpenX. Included in the github is the java code used to create the different parts of the app. Left out configuration for privacy.
